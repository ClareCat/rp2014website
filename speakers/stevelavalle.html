bio: Steve LaValle started working with Oculus VR a few days after its successful Kickstarter campaign and led its R&D efforts up to its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook in March 2014.  He developed perceptually tuned head tracking methods used in the Oculus Rift, based on IMUs and computer vision.  He also led a team of perceptual psychologists to provide principled approaches to virtual reality system calibration and the design of comfortable user experiences.  He is also Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois.  He has worked in robotics for over 20 years and is known for his introduction of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRTs) algorithm of motion planning and his book, Planning Algorithms.
abstract: Using the latest technology, we can safely hijack your most trusted senses, thereby fooling your brain into believing you are in another world.  Virtual reality (VR) has been around for a long time, but due to the recent convergence of sensing, display, and computation technologies, there is an unprecedented opportunity to explore this form of human augmentation with lightweight, low-cost materials and simple software platforms. This is an intense form of human-computer interaction (HCI) that requires re-examining core engineering principles with a direct infusion of perceptual psychology research. Developing systems that optimize classical criteria might lead to overcomplicated solutions that are too slow or costly in practice, and yet could make no perceptible difference to users. Simple adaptation of techniques that were developed for on-screen viewing, such as cinematography and first-person shooter game play, often lead to unpleasent VR experiences due the presentation of unusual stimuli or due to mismatches between the human vestibular system and other senses. With the rapid rise in consumer VR, fundamental research questions are popping up everywhere, slicing across numerous disciplines from engineering to socialogy to film to medicine.  This talk will provide some perspective on where we have been and where we might be going next.
