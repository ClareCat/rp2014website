tagline: Cydia - Primary Developer
bio: Jay Freeman (@saurik) is the primary developer and community manager of Cydia, a platform that enables modification and extension of third-party software on "jailbroken" devices running iOS or Android. He also develops Cycript, an interactive tool for manipulating and exploring running applications on iOS and Mac OS X using a hybrid of Objective-C and JavaScript. On the side, Jay teaches classes on programming at the College of Creative Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, with a focus on those just beginning to be interested in software.
abstract: In the modern world—a world where software has become one of our most important tools—a lot of attention is given to the idea of “open source”; a revolution that has made the behavior of software transparent and empowered users to maintain and enhance the code they rely on in their everyday lives. In this talk, I will first examine some of the edge cases and even limitations of open software, especially as we see closed hardware begin to dominate the ecosystem. I will then focus on the elusory boundary between “open” and “closed”, showing the techniques used to “modify the unmodifiable”, both in analysis and instrumentation, going into particular detail on the phenomenon of “jailbroken” devices running iOS and Android. Finally, I will discuss some of the challenges this culture of “malleable software” faces and how you can help, touching on issues of legality, practicality, and morality, exploring individual motivation, societal expectation, and governmental regulation. (Please note that my talks are fast-paced and wide-reaching, so I recommend splashing some cold water on your face before attending ;P.)
