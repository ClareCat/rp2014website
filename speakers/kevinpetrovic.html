bio: At 20 years old, Kevin Petrovic is the eldest among FlightCar’s three co­founders. An entrepreneur since age 9, Kevin dropped out of Princeton University to devote his time to FlightCar, which he sees as revolutionizing the way people get to and from the airport. The idea came about one day when he and  best friend and co­founder Rujul Zaparde (CEO) were talking about Airbnb. Kevin had just come back  from a trip, and was thinking about how expensive parking and car rentals were and how they added to airport congestion and waste. Together, they believed FlightCar, a new car­sharing business focused on the airport customer, could overall improve a traveler’s experience, and encourage travel. Before FlightCar, Kevin ran a successful business that generated over half a million dollars in annual revenue and co­founded an award­ winning clean water NGO, called Drinking Water for India with FlightCar CEO  Rujul. Kevin is a voracious reader of news and blogs, loves to swim and has competed internationally as a pianist. Although Kevin technically resides in San Francisco, he is on the road more often than not.
abstract: Everyone has ideas. But can you, and should you, try to start a startup with yours? Concepts that may seem great on the surface may never translate into an investable company, while a new technology which may have no immediately apparent applications may one day change the world. What should you look for when evaluating an opportunity - from your perspective, but also from the eyes of potential investors down the line? And finally, many people work hard to turn their dreams into a reality, only to see everything fall apart - and not because of a poor idea, but rather, because of something that could have been avoided. What are the best ways to avoid falling into that kind of trap?
