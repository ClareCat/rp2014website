bio: Before the Julia language project, Jeff Bezanson worked as a software engineer at Interactive Supercomputing, which developed the Star-P parallel extension to MATLAB.

Jeff has an A.B. in Computer Science from Harvard University (2004).
abstract: Some feel we need one ideal programming language, others feel we need a different one for each task. Who is right? I will discuss some of the myths and realities of programming language adoption we have encountered while developing the Julia language, and the design philosophy we have gradually developed at the same time.
